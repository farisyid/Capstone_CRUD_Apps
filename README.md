# Capstone_Project_Module1
## Introduce
Welcome to my github.
This is my first capstone project as a student Purwadhika Job Connector Program Data Science. This is capstone project in module 1 : python fundamental.
In this project will be talking about a simple application that has CRUD features. which means C to create, R to read, U to update, D to delete

in this application there may be shortcomings, please excuse it because it is still in the learning stage. But i tried my best.

Make sure you run the programme in an environment that has support for Python and the required libraries. If you encounter any problems while running the programme or entering inputs, be sure to follow the instructions provided by the programme.
This programme is a simple simulation and does not replace a real patient management system. This programme is for educational and demonstration purposes only.

This application is an application made for learning the basics of Python programming, if there are questions about the application and there are suggestions that want to be given I will be happy to accommodate, here is my email farisyid@gmail.com. Thank you.
